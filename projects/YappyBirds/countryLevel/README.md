# Tiled Level Editor
The Tiled Level Editor for YappyBirds is a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get), editor.
The Layers that can be added are Tile Layers and Object Layers.
The game will render the tiles and objects the same way you see in the Mini-map of Tiled.
The distance between the Tile and Object layers are predefined, so to make the layers further away you would need to add more layers.

Map size          : 64 tiles by 64 tiles
